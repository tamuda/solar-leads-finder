## 🎯 Components

### StatsCards
Displays key metrics:
- Total Buildings
- Total Roof Area (sqft)
- Solar Capacity (kW)
- Average Score

### ChartsSection
Three interactive charts:
- **Building Types** - Pie chart showing distribution
- **Score Distribution** - Bar chart of score ranges
- **Buildings by City** - Horizontal bar chart

### MapView
- Shows geocoded building locations
- Links to Google Maps for each building
- Displays top 6 locations with scores

### LeadsTable
Comprehensive table with:
- Ranking by score
- Full address
- Building type (color-coded)
- Roof area
- Solar capacity
- Score (color-coded by priority)
- Google Maps links

## 🎨 Design Features

- **Glassmorphism** - Frosted glass effect on cards
- **Gradient Backgrounds** - Smooth color transitions
- **Hover Effects** - Interactive elements respond to user
- **Color-Coded Scores**:
  - 🟢 Green (70-100): High Priority

## 📱 Responsive Breakpoints

- **Mobile**: < 768px
- **Tablet**: 768px - 1024px
- **Desktop**: > 1024px

## 🔧 API Routes

### GET /api/buildings
Returns all building data as JSON.

**Response:**
```json
[
  {
    "building_id": "UNY_001",
    "address": "100 State Street, Rochester, NY 14614",
    "city": "Rochester",
    "state": "NY",
    "lat": 43.157784,
    "lng": -77.613760,
    "building_type": "office",
    "building_area_sqft": 45000,
    "estimated_roof_area": 3937.5,
    "solar_capacity_kw": 39.375,
    "score": 75,
    "geocoded": true
  }
]
```

## 🎯 Future Enhancements

- [ ] Export filtered data to CSV
- [ ] Interactive map with Mapbox/Google Maps
- [ ] Building detail modal/page
- [ ] Lead status tracking (contacted, interested, closed)
- [ ] Email integration for outreach
- [ ] AI-powered lead scoring refinement
- [ ] Real-time data updates
- [ ] User authentication
- [ ] Multi-region support

## 📝 Notes

- The dashboard automatically filters out buildings without geocoding data from the map view
- Scores are calculated by the Python backend based on multiple factors
- All monetary values and capacities are estimates

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

**Dashboard not loading data:**
- Ensure the CSV file exists at `../data/raw/upstate_ny_buildings.csv`
- Check the browser console for API errors
- Verify the Python demo has been run to generate data

**Port 3001 already in use:**
- Next.js will automatically use the next available port
- Check the terminal output for the actual port number

**Charts not rendering:**
- Ensure all dependencies are installed: `npm install`
- Clear the Next.js cache: `rm -rf .next`
